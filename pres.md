## What is Scrum?
Scrum is a popular framework that facilitates collaboration between teams while they are working on complex projects and products.

## Scrum Beat
Sprint - it runs from one to four weeks and have set beginning and ending dates.

>The beat of the Scrum is the Sprint, typically it runs from one to four weeks and have set beginning and ending dates

## Scrum Roles
* The product owner
>The product owner helps the development team prioritize their work, controls the product backlog, and speaks out for the client's interests.

* The scrum master
>The scrum master helps the team in maintaining its commitment to the scrum principles.

* The development team
>The development team makes the decisions regarding the work to be completed, produces increments, and shows group accountability.

## Common Metrics

* Sprint Goal Success
>By defining sprint goals and then measuring how many sprints met the goal, you can get a qualitative assessment of a scrum team’s work.

* Escaped Defects and Defect Density
>Escaped defects is a crucial metric that shows how many bugs were experienced by users in production
>Defect density is also worth watching—it measures number of defects per software size, for example per lines of code

* Team Velocity
>Velocity measures how many user stories were completed by the team, on average, in previous sprints. It assists in estimating how much work the team is able to accomplish in future sprints.

## How Does Scrum Work?

Step 1: Product Backlog
>The product backlog is used to draw up a list of tasks that a team must complete to successfully achieve the stakeholders’ goals. 

Step 2: Sprint Planning
>Selected tasks from the product backlog are chosen for teams to focus and work on and to be delivered during the sprint.

Step 3: Sprint Backlog
>Tasks discussed in the previous phase are added into the sprint backlog. 

Step 4: Scrum Team
>A scrum team is usually a team of five to nine members that work on the tasks mentioned in the sprint backlog. 

Step 4.1: Daily Scrum
>The team has daily scrum meetings, 15 minute long sessions during which the team members synchronize their activities with each other, report on the bottlenecks they are facing, and plan on what they aim to achieve in the next 24 hours.

Step 5: Sprint Review
>After the sprint is completed, it’s time for a sprint review. The product owner, scrum master, stakeholders, and the scrum team attend the meeting. During this stage, the team discusses what they accomplished in the previous sprint. The session also opens up opportunities to ask questions, make observations, and provide feedback and suggestions. 

Step 5.1: Sprint Review: Product Backlog
>The product owner presents the backlog’s top to the stakeholders. This lets the former receive feedback for upcoming sprints and other things related to the backlog. 

Step 5.2: Sprint Review: Sprint Retrospective
>The sprint retrospective meeting follows the sprint review. Here, the team identifies potential mistakes and issues, as well as ways to handle them. Data from this stage is incorporated while planning the next sprint.

Step 6: Increment
>The stakeholders receive a workable and usable output. 

## When to Use Scrum?

1. When requirements are not clearly defined

>Many times, a client has a general idea of the product to develop, but he does not have clear or well-defined details of how it must be. Not having a clear definition of the requirements has several consequences.

>One of them is that it is practically impossible to make an estimation of the time and costs that would allow us to approach the project as a Fixed Price. Secondly, if the requirements are not defined, it is expected that, there will be a large number of changes during the development, which would make the use of a more traditional methodology more difficult.

>This is when the use of Scrum is inevitable and more than convenient because of its flexible and adaptable nature throughout the entire process.

2. When the probability of changes during the development is high

>While in software development, the changes of requirements can be a kind of common currency with specific processes for managing them. There are times when, despite the fact that the requirements are correctly defined, adaptations are likely to arise as the project progresses. This situation can occur in projects where, for example, there are technological changes or in the business context.

3. When where is a need to test the solution

>This point is very related to the previous ones. In the construction of a new product, an MVP (minimum viable product) can be required in order to test certain characteristics in the market that you may want to verify, and that allows it to be iterated with the results obtained from that test.
As a result of this process, some changes are generated that have an impact on what has already been developed, or new ideas and features to be developed are generated.

4. When the product owner is fully available

>The participation, dedication, and total availability of the PO in the project is a fundamental pillar for the correct use of Scrum.
The PO is the owner of the backlog, so it is he or she who prioritizes the User Stories and helps the team to refine the definitions.
If a client does not have a PO available for the project, it is very difficult for the implementation of this methodology to be successful.

5. When contraction is time and material
>Even though some Scrum practices can be applied to Fixed Price projects, the best alternative is to use Scrum so that all the necessary changes can be made throughout the development.

6. When the team has self-management skills

>Agile working teams require that their members have a certain level of seniority because while there is the figure of the Scrum Master, the project requires a lot of self-management and collaboration. If the development team is very inexperienced, the correct implementation of these types of methodologies may become more complex.

7. When the client's culture is open to innovation and adapts to change

>Finally, it is important to understand whether or not the client has experience with Scrum projects and if they are open to using this type of methodology.

>It is very common that one of the biggest concerns is how much it costs and how long it will take to develop the product. Even though Agile methodologies such as Scrum make it possible to have a plan, a north, this is very difficult to determine in advance given the very nature of this methodology that accepts change at all times.

>In order to counteract this, it is essential that trust is established between both parties so that the client feels that the team is doing its best to achieve the objectives.

>That's all for this topic, thank you for listening, buy!
